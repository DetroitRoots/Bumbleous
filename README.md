<h1> Bumbleous </h1> 
<h5> Machine operator AI technology for any vehicle &amp; any budget.</h5>

 # Public Statement: 

-  I will need lots of investigation and studies to be able to add more features and shape this project as how I want. 
 - Doing this whole project alone along with my other projects will take time and dedication and this public statement helps me for this.
 - This project will be helpful for me to be better at coding and give me (and other participants if there will ever be) enough knowledge for more complex and more exciting AI projects.
 - Mindset: Better to start and learn doing from mistakes than waiting the right time to start without doing it. 
 - If the project gets a successfull process, hopefully we will be able to see AI controlled vehicles in the traffic suitable to any budget and family.
 - As complete defender of cyber privacy, cyber security and someone who never gives credit to closed source, every single part of this software will be open source and transperent like a glass, forever.
