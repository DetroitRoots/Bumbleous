 # Public Statement: 

-  I will need lots of time to add more features and put this project into a shape according to how I want. 
 - Doing this whole project alone along with my other projects will take time and dedication. If you're wondering about when it will finish, there's currently no timeline.
 - This project will give me enough knowledge for more complex and more exciting AI projects.
 - If the project gets a successfull progress, we will be able to see AI controlled vehicles in the traffic suitable to any vehicle and family.
