- If the project gets a successfull progress, we will be able to see AI controlled vehicles in the traffic suitable to any vehicle and family.
- It's about creating a self operating computer system that can be mounted externally to any vehicle.
- The device must be programmed according to the characteristics of each specific vehicle.

This is not even %1 of the project. The ai is in it's very first phase and needs improvements. 
However, the ai is only a small part of the project, the main goal is to make a whole new system that can control a vehicle without human assistance.
