<h1 align='center'> Machine operator AI technology for any vehicle </h1> 

- If the project gets a successfull progress, we will be able to see AI controlled vehicles in the traffic suitable to any vehicle and family.
- It's about creating a self operating computer system that can be mounted externally to any vehicle.
- The device must be programmed according to the characteristics of each specific vehicle. 
- I want first release to be a Volkswagen Beatle, the name came from Transformers movie Bumblebee.

This is not even %1 of the plan. The ai is not good enough, I need to improve it, it has lack of trained images. But this ai is only a small part of the idea, the main goal is to make a whole new system that can control a vehicle without human assistance.
